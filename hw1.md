operators
assertions
## 2 
How do OCaml if expressions compare and contrast with if commands in imperative languages, such as Java and Python? And with ternary operators? (If you're not already familiar with ternary operators in those languages, now's a good time to look them up!)

Do the exercises named values, if, assert, and more fun from the exercises section at the end of chapter 2 of the 3110 textbook.
